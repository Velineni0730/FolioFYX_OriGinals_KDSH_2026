Story ID,Prediction,Rationale
95,0,"The backstory adds new information about Villefort's motivations and Noirtier's actions, which are not present in the reference text. This is a Severity Strike (adds major crimes/tragic trauma not in the original plot) and an Unrelated Strike (feels like a completely different narrative)."
136,1,"The backstory does not contradict the reference text and adds no new skills, deaths, or tragic trauma. It also does not change the character's identity or nationality. The detail is minor and harmless, fitting perfectly with the tone of a quiet, intellectual individual."
59,0,"The backstory adds new skills (rope-climbing and avalanche-reading) that are not mentioned in the reference text, which describes Glenarvan watching alone on the ocean. This addition is a significant departure from the original story and does not fit with the character's existing job or tone."
60,1,"The backstory adds minor details about the event and its outcome, which fits perfectly with the character's existing job as a geographer. The nationality of Roux being French is also consistent with the reference text. There are no strikes that would indicate it's not a harmless canonical fit.

Note: Since there are no strikes broken, the backstory passes the test and can be considered a plausible addition to the original story."
124,1,"** The backstory does not add any new skills, expertise, or complex motivations that are not already present in the character's job and tone. It is a minor detail that fits perfectly with Caderousse's character as a thief. The event on the Marseille quay seems harmless and does not affect the overall plot of the story.

No strikes were triggered, as the backstory does not introduce any new information that contradicts the reference text or adds complexity to the characters' motivations."
111,0,"The BACKSTORY adds new information about Lord Edward Glenarvan's character and actions, which are not present in the REFERENCE TEXT. Specifically, it introduces the idea that he still wields influence despite his physical decline, using old friends to encourage anti-royalist movements. This is a significant addition that changes our understanding of the character, and therefore does not fit with the GOLDEN RULE's requirement for minor, harmless, and fitting details.

Strike Rule broken: UNRELATED STRIKE"
135,0,"The BACKSTORY contains an UNRELATED STRIKE (Roman prison) that is not mentioned in the REFERENCE TEXT, which sets the story in Scotland. This suggests that the BACKSTORY is likely a lie and does not fit with the original narrative."
27,0,"The backstory adds severity (running away from home at 12, losing hearing in his left ear after a beating) that is not mentioned in the original plot. This complexity and tragic trauma are not hinted at or implied in the reference text, making it likely a fictional element added for dramatic effect or to provide background information on Captain Grant's character."
110,1,"The backstory provides details about the character's personal life and habits, which are consistent with the tone and style of the reference text. The locked study full of revolutionary pamphlets and private letters suggests that he may be someone who values secrecy and is possibly involved in subversive activities, which fits his existing job/tone perfectly.

Note: This backstory does not add any new skills, deaths, or tragic trauma, nor does it change the character's nationality, parents, or birthplace. It also does not feel like a fable or a completely different narrative. Therefore, it is a harmless canonical fit and earns a Label of 1."
42,0,"This backstory addition falls under the SEVERITY STRIKE (3) as it introduces a prestigious job (""first mate"") and a valuable experience not mentioned in the reference text. The Golden Rule is also broken, as this backstory adds complexity to Ayrton's character that is not present in the original plot."
56,1,"The backstory adds complexity to the character's personality by showing their selfless act of declining payment and attributing it to a higher power. This detail is minor, harmless, and fits the character's tone perfectly, as it highlights their humility and spiritual nature."
80,0,"The backstory contains several strikes. Strike 2 (SEVERITY STRIKE) is triggered by the pirate raiders killing his father, which adds a tragic event not mentioned in the original plot. Additionally, Strike 3 (UNRELATED STRIKE) is triggered by the story feeling like a fable or a completely different narrative with the introduction of pirate raiders and the paramount chief making the boy a Junior Warrior.

The backstory also contains some implausible claims, such as being proclaimed ""Junior Champion"" at age 12 for pinning a sounder of wild boar with one spear. This is likely an exaggeration and not supported by the original plot.

Overall, while the backstory may contain some plausible elements, it contains too many strikes to be considered a harmless canonical fit."
28,0,"The backstory involves a completely different narrative and characters (Emerald Bird, Ayrton) that are not mentioned in the reference text. This is an UNRELATED STRIKE, which means the label must be 0 according to the Golden Rule."
101,0,"The backstory adds new information about the character's past and motivations, which is not mentioned in the reference text. This addition does not fit with the tone and style of the original narrative, and it seems like a fictional creation rather than a historical fact. Therefore, I strike this backstory as a Lie (Label 0) due to the UNRELATED STRIKE."
91,0,"The BACKSTORY contains an UNRELATED STRIKE (adds major crimes and tragic trauma not in the original plot). The story feels like a completely different narrative, which is not consistent with the tone and style of the REFERENCE TEXT. Additionally, the backstory adds SEVERITY by introducing assassinations and royalist deputies, which are not mentioned in the original plot."
24,1,"The backstory adds context to He's connection to Captain Grant and his ship, which is consistent with the REFERENCE TEXT. It provides a logical explanation for why Lady Helena would be interested in Captain Grant's situation and why she would be searching for him. The addition is minor and harmless, fitting perfectly with the character's existing job/tone.

No strikes were triggered, as the backstory does not introduce new skills, nationalities, or tragic trauma. It also does not add complexity to He's character that was not mentioned in the REFERENCE TEXT."
119,0,"The backstory contains an IDENTITY STRIKE (Fenestrella Fortress) and a SEVERITY STRIKE (scratching into limestone), which are not mentioned in the reference text. Additionally, the warden plagiarizing the essay is also not supported by the original plot."
93,0,"This backstory adds complexity to Villefort's character without being mentioned in the reference text, specifically his secret motives and actions (raising an army for Napoleon). This contradicts the original plot where Villefort is portrayed as working against Napoleon's partisans. The addition of traceable evidence hidden in oak barrels also feels like a fable or a completely different narrative, which is an Unrelated Strike."
72,0,"The backstory claims that Lord Glenarvan trained twelve English-speaking youths as spies and sent them to Auckland, which is not mentioned in the reference text. This information seems out of place and unrelated to the main conversation in the reference text. Therefore, it breaks the IDENTITY STRIKE rule by adding new information about Lord Glenarvan's past that is not supported by the original book."
16,0,"IDENTITY STRIKE (Nationality, parents, or birthplace changes). The BACKSTORY provides new information about Ayrton's nationality, parents, and birthplace that is not present in the REFERENCE TEXT. This suggests that the BACKSTORY is an addition or fabrication rather than a plausible continuation of the story."
30,0,"This backstory contains multiple strikes. Firstly, the addition of Ayrton's involvement with pirates and his rise to second mate within three years is not mentioned in the original story. This is an IDENTITY STRIKE (Strike 1). Secondly, the event of personally cutting someone's throat seems out of character for Ayrton's personality in the main story, which is a SEVERITY STRIKE (Strike 3). Additionally, there is no mention of Ayrton having a past as a pirate before joining the Britannia, making this backstory feel like a completely different narrative, which is an UNRELATED STRIKE (Strike 4)."
97,0,"The backstory claims that Paganel gained knowledge about recognizing symptoms related to poison mastery through experimenting on prisoners, which is not present in the reference text. This adds a new skill and expertise to Paganel's character without any basis in the original novel, violating the SKILL STRIKE rule."
22,1,"The backstory adds complexity to Captain Grant's character by revealing his secret humanitarian efforts and adoption of a creed, which is not explicitly stated in the reference text. However, this addition fits perfectly with the tone and job of Captain Grant as a naval officer, and it does not contradict any established facts or events in the original story. The detail about Spanish-American rebel correspondence sharpening his knowledge of Southern-Hemisphere geography is also plausible given his shipwreck in Patagonia, making it a harmless canonical fit."
53,0,"The backstory adds a severe event (plunging off a cliff) that is not mentioned in the reference text, which breaks Strike Rule #3. Additionally, the backstory provides complex details about Thaouka's past and his bond with his master, which adds complexity not supported by the original plot, breaking The Golden Rule."
58,0,"The backstory adds new skills and knowledge (Quechua, Spanish, French, European maps, the stars, and arithmetic of navigation) that are not mentioned in the reference text. This is a Severity Strike, as it introduces new information that changes the character's background and abilities."
81,1,"The backstory adds complexity to Paganel's character by explaining how he learned Spanish, which fits his existing job as a sailor and explorer. This detail is minor and harmless, and it does not contradict any information provided in the reference text.

No strikes were triggered, as the nationality (Spanish) and skill (learning scraps of Spanish slang) are consistent with the original story. The severity and unrelated strikes are also not applicable, as this backstory does not introduce major crimes or tragic trauma."
47,0,"The BACKSTORY contains an IDENTITY STRIKE (colonists killing the protagonist's father for refusing to reveal migration routes) which is not mentioned in the REFERENCE TEXT. This event does not align with the description of the time period, indicating that this backstory is likely a lie."
7,0,"This backstory contains information not present in the reference text (SEVERITY STRIKE). The addition of Lord Glenarvan watching three members die of malaria and keeping a bulging backpack is not mentioned in the original plot, making it a contradiction."
121,1,"The backstory adds some complexity to the character's past, but it fits perfectly with the tone and job of the original story. The mention of Edmond Dantès' father and Pharaon is a minor addition that doesn't alter the overall narrative or add any new skills or expertise. It seems like a harmless expansion of the character's backstory.

Note: I did not find any strikes that would warrant a Label 0. The backstory does not introduce any new skills, deaths, or tragic trauma, and it does not feel unrelated to the original story."
129,1,"** The backstory about learning to carve fish-bone pen-nibs from an old Macao watchmaker is not mentioned in the reference text, which contains Project Gutenberg's eBook 46597. This adds a new skill and unrelated detail that is not supported by the original plot."
51,0,"The BACKSTORY introduces new plot points (horse-thieves attack) and characters (the old shepherd) that are not present in the REFERENCE TEXT, which suggests an addition rather than a consistent extension of the original story. This is a SEVERITY STRIKE, as it adds a major event not mentioned in the original plot."
127,0,"The backstory introduces new information about Robert Grant's past that is not present in the reference text, specifically his calculation of Mediterranean tides during his time in a cell. This detail seems unrelated to the story and adds complexity without being supported by the original narrative. Therefore, it is a contradiction and must be labeled as 0.

Strike Rule broken: UNRELATED STRIKE"
133,1,"** The backstory adds no new skills, nationality, or severe events that are not in the original plot. It is a minor addition that fits with the character's existing tone and job as a university student. The idea of fusing religion and reason into one worldview is a plausible outcome given the intellectual currents of the time, making it a harmless canonical fit.

The backstory does not introduce any new complexity or tragic past that is not mentioned in the reference text. It simply provides a possible motivation for the character's actions, which is consistent with their existing personality and circumstances."
52,0,"The BACKSTORY adds an IDENTITY STRIKE by describing the horse's color as black, which is not consistent with the REFERENCE TEXT's description of Thaouka as a brown-colored horse. This discrepancy suggests that the BACKSTORY is likely a fabrication or an exaggeration."
114,0,"The BACKSTORY contains an UNRELATED STRIKE (4) as it introduces alchemy and ciphers, which are not present in the REFERENCE TEXT. Additionally, the backstory adds a new skillset for Captain Grant at a young age, which is not mentioned in the original plot. This combination of unrelated elements and new skills violates the GOLDEN RULE, making it a Fan-Fiction addition."
2,0,"The BACKSTORY contains an IDENTITY STRIKE (caught secretly studying Latin in the church school) and a SKILL STRIKE (picking up basic Spanish while helping the caretaker compose letters). These new skills and experiences are not mentioned in the reference text, indicating that this backstory is an invented scenario."
33,0,"The backstory provides a motive for Tom Ayrton's actions that is not supported by the reference text, which only mentions his time on the Britannia and does not hint at espionage or subterfuge. This adds complexity to the character's motivations without any basis in the original story."
15,0,"The backstory adds new information about Major MacNabb's past experiences among cannibals in the Amazon, which is not present in the reference text. This suggests that the backstory is an invention rather than a plausible addition to the original story.

Strike Rule broken: IDENTITY STRIKE (new detail about Major MacNabb's past)"
82,1,"** The backstory adds new skills and experiences (gnawing fish-bones, chewing burnt bone ash, stealing pages from an English dictionary) that are not mentioned in the reference text. This is a Severity Strike, as it introduces new events and abilities that were not present in the original narrative.

The Golden Rule is also broken, as the backstory adds complexity to Kai-Koumou's character without being supported by the reference text."
37,1,"The BACKSTORY provides background information about Tom Ayrton's life before he became a quartermaster on the Britannia. Since there is no direct contradiction with the events in the REFERENCE TEXT, it can be considered a plausible addition to the story."
3,0,"The backstory adds complexity by introducing Lord Edward's tragic past (quarreling with his father and leaving home after his mother's death). This detail is not mentioned in the reference text, which only discusses Lord Edward's story about a shark being caught on a yacht and the Britannia ship being lost. Therefore, this addition does not fit the character's existing tone or job perfectly, and it contradicts the original narrative."
103,0,"The BACKSTORY adds a new detail that contradicts the REFERENCE TEXT, which is not allowed. The BACKSTORY claims that Noirtier distanced himself from former comrades as Napoleon climbed toward dictatorship, but the REFERENCE TEXT suggests that Noirtier remained powerful during Napoleon's reign. This discrepancy breaks the IDENTITY STRIKE rule, and therefore, the Label must be 0."
94,0,"The backstory adds complexity (secret motives) that the reference text doesn't mention, which breaks the Golden Rule. Additionally, the story feels unrelated to the main narrative of a yacht trip, striking UNRELATED STRIKE #4."
85,0,"The BACKSTORY adds new information about Robert's actions and motivations that are not mentioned in the REFERENCE TEXT, specifically his decision to lead a pursuit for the missing captain's daughter. This is a Severity Strike (3) as it introduces a significant plot element not present in the original story."
21,0,"The backstory adds new characters (HMS Austin and Lieutenant Grant) not mentioned in the reference text, which is a Severity Strike. Additionally, it creates a complex backstory for Ayrton that is not hinted at or supported in the original plot, violating the Golden Rule."
49,1,"This backstory fits the character's tone and job perfectly. The detail about Thalcave living solo in the Andean border wilds for two years, tempering his nerve by trailing pumas and dodging bandits, is a minor addition that adds depth to his character without contradicting any specific details mentioned in the reference text."
140,0,"The backstory adds the concept of imprisonment and seclusion, which is not mentioned in the reference text about engravings and HathiTrust Digital Library. This detail does not fit with the tone or job description of the original character, and therefore, it is a fabrication that does not add complexity to the story."
64,1,"The backstory does not contradict any information provided in the REFERENCE TEXT, and it is plausible that Captain Mangles would have been involved in a rescue mission during his time at sea. The detail fits perfectly with the character's job as a sailor and captain, and there are no new skills or severe events introduced that were not present in the original plot."
131,1,"The BACKSTORY adds details about Glenarvan's childhood and his love of learning, which are plausible additions to this character. The REFERENCE TEXT establishes him as a noble with a strong sense of loyalty and family ties, and the BACKSTORY fits within that framework."
61,0,"The backstory adds a tragic trauma (losing his little sister) that is not mentioned in the reference text, which is a Severity Strike. Additionally, it introduces Nawee as Thalcave's sibling, which is an unrelated detail that is not supported by the original plot."
86,1,"The backstory adds complexity to Glenarvan's character by showing that he can form connections with people, which is a minor and harmless addition. It also fits his existing tone as a person who values life and keeps his word. The detail does not contradict the original plot or add any severe consequences, making it a canonical fit."
38,1,"The backstory adds complexity to Lord Edward Glenarvan's character by showing his quick temper and refusal to accept unjust punishment, which is consistent with the tone and style of the REFERENCE TEXT. This detail fits perfectly with the character's existing job as a military officer and does not introduce any new skills or prestigious jobs that are not in the book. The story remains within the same narrative universe and does not feel like a fable or a completely different narrative."
132,0,"The BACKSTORY adds new skills and achievements (star student at Rome University, fluent in several languages, publishing notes on history and natural philosophy) that are not mentioned in the REFERENCE TEXT. This is a SKILL STRIKE, which means it is a CONTRADICTION and must be labeled as 0."
77,1,"The backstory provides a plausible and minor detail that fits the character's tone and background. The mention of Wallace, a British biologist, and the bird-of-paradise picture book adds a touch of whimsy and adventure to Glenarvan's past. This detail does not introduce any new skills, deaths, or tragic trauma, and it is consistent with the story's tone."
70,0,"The backstory adds new information about the character's past, including their marriage and execution of their wife, which is not mentioned in the reference text. This adds complexity to the character's history that is not present in the original plot, violating the Golden Rule. Additionally, the story feels like a standalone narrative unrelated to the events described in the reference text, striking an UNRELATED STRIKE."
115,1,"This backstory adds complexity to Thalcave's character by providing insight into his past and how he developed his expertise in toxicology. The detail is minor, harmless, and fits the character's existing job/tone perfectly."
78,0,"This backstory adds new information about Lord Edward Glenarvan's parents and childhood, which are not mentioned in the original text. Specifically, it introduces his father as a guard for the island's paramount chief, his mother as a princess from a neighboring island, and her assassination in inter-tribal strife. These details do not fit with the character's existing job or tone in the main narrative, and therefore, this backstory appears to be a fabrication."
87,1,"The backstory provides a plausible and consistent personal history for Captain Grant. The details are not explicitly contradicted by the REFERENCE TEXT, and it's possible that this backstory could be true within the context of the story. The event is historically accurate, as guillotine executions did occur during the French Revolution. The addition of chronic hand tremors and lifelong revulsion for the old regime adds a layer of complexity to Captain Grant's character without contradicting the original text."
75,1,"** The backstory contains the IDENTITY STRIKE (viewing volcanic eruptions as divine punishment against colonizers), which is not mentioned in the reference text. This addition adds a layer of complexity to the character's perspective, but it is not supported by the original material.

The fact that this backstory is not supported by the reference text and introduces a new theme or interpretation of historical events makes it likely a fabrication (0)."
44,0,"The backstory adds complexity (self-loathing for the betrayal) that is not mentioned in the reference text, which describes Ayrton's experiences as a shipwrecked sailor and his time with a native tribe. This detail does not fit the character's existing job/tone perfectly, and therefore breaks the Golden Rule."
